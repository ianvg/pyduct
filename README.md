## Note!
This project is a branch of the work done by @Tokarzewski in the project pyduct.

The purpose of this branch is to work on developing a basic GUI and fleshing out some of the fittings data, to be more comprehensive.

In addition, I am interested in crossing over functionality and data from imperial units, so this database is useful for international and American engineers.

## pyduct

Work in progress python library for ductwork calculations.

### What this can do?

1. ductwork sizing  
2. pressure drop calculations  

## What are the future features?

3. duct and duct fittings library  
4. acoustic calculations  

### Who's it intender for?

It is for building services engineers.

### What problem does the software solve?

Open-source and free duct design tool that can be used in streamlined ductwork design processes.

### How is it going to work?

pyduct will take structured ductwork input file, calculate it and produce results.

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/Tokarzewski/pyduct.git  
navigate to pyduct folder
